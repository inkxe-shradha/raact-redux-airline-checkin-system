# Please look in to this As I am not able to connect the reviewer directly

- I implemented the total app and all the responsiveness using the `MATERIAL UI` createTheme and `makeStyles` Hooks.
- It is recommended to use `MUI-THEME` styling instead normal `SASS` theming as `MUI` given the dynamic configuration on CSS files.
- I used the sass configuration only the `404` page component.
- I am trying to write the `test-cases` for the login component.

# Admin User Name and Password

['admin@gmail.com', 'Admin@123']

# Staff user name and password

['user@gmail.com', 'User@123']

# For google login {`For working in Google login you have to run project in localhost:3000`}

# Command need to be run

`npm i` => `npm start` => Open your browser URL

# Last suggestion

- It will difficult to understand the reviewer notes as we are not able to connect with reviewer directly and understand the developer through out the process.
- And there are no proper design given on the documentation so by imagining the cases and developing is little more complicated. So I made this kind mistake
